# Infinite Carousel Docs

_Documentation for Infinite Carousel, a timed carousel scroller that uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS animations. It supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling. It's useful if you need a UI element to infinitely scroll (ex: ticker being displayed on a TV monitor)._

## Getting Started

**Install dependencies**
```bash
gem install jekyll
```

**Run Locally**
```bash
jekyll serve --watch
```
